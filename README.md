### Compiling and deploying Perfume ###
Perfume requires the cheetah python library. 

Install with `$pip install cheetah`
You can get pip [here](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html).

Files are included in the templates to ease development and avoid repeating code.

For example,

`  #include "./template/css_template.html"` includes the css files into the template. The main template is index_template.html, which generates index.html.

To deploy, see [how to deploy Perfume](https://github.com/ModelInference/perfume-frontend/wiki/HowtodeployPerfume).
